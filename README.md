# Windows Folders - Set All to General Items
Clears explorer registry values for "Music" "Videos" etc. and sets all system folders to General Items so default sort columns are "Date modified", "Type", and "Size" - how it should be... Useful for those with projects with media files where you're just trying to sort things more often than see what the Album and Contributing Artist was (???).

Usage

1.Run with PowerShell (or run from an elevated PowerShell window). 

  1b. OR just run the .reg and restart Explorer manually

2.Optionally, afterward open any folder, configure your preferred layout, and click View → Options → Apply to Folders to lock that view in system-wide.
