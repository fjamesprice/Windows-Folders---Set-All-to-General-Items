# Windows-Folders---Set-All-to-General-Items
Clears explorer registry values for "Music" "Videos" etc. and sets all system folders to General Items so default sort columns are "Date modified", "Type", and "Size" - how it should be... Useful for those with projects with media files where you're just trying to sort things more often than see what the Album and Contributing Artist was (???).
